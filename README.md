# Overview

In this project, I strive to get any better understanding of the design and styling of a website application. My main goal Was to gain an understanding of JavaScript, and how it can be applied to HTML and CSS to create cool graphics and effects. I practice using JavaScript to create the following to do list application.

The To-Do list application was designed to practice JavaScript in adding cool features such as box is holding to do list items, and the ability to add graphics to mark them as done and delete them when no longer needed.

Not only did I write the software to gain a better understanding of how to use JavaScript, but also to create a application that I can use in my daily life to keep track of my busy work, school and home  schedule.

# Development Environment

I used a mixture of websites and tutorial videos to gain a understanding of how JavaScript works and refresh my mind on aspects of HTML and CSS. I primarily used w3schools to gain an idea of concepts and tutorials to see the concepts in action.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used VS code to run my JavaScript. In total, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design and develop the website application. I also used Google fonts and The font awesome librarys.

# Future Work

- I want to add a saving feature, as well as a history feature. 
- I want to add a notes section to my to do list objects to leave optionally visible notes to read it later. 
- I felt that I didn't really understand how to use recursion while using JavaScript, and like to go back and implement recursion throughout the application.
